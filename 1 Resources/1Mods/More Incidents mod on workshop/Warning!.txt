**************************************************************************************
I do not allow any use of my mods for personal use and publishing it by your name. 
Any theft of my mods will sooner or later be discovered and then reported.
If you want to steal something from my mods then think about it. 
It is absolutely forbidden to edit my items from mods. 
Instead of stealing, do something yourself.
It is not without reason that I sign "mods by BartussX" in every possible file for someone to publish something without permission.
I hope I said it clearly.
