	<!--Really, please don't use my mods for yourself. Do not edit or publish them. It is not difficult to create something yourself. If you want to create incidents, use game files.
 I don't want to be selfish, but a lot of work has been done so that others can enjoy the game.
 There is a great guide on how to create mods (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2095964545) created by eMka. I hope you will understand this. Thank you.

 The use of vehicles, incidents, hats, calls, e-mails, etc. ( Mod Team 112 ) and publishing them at the workshop without our consent is strictly forbidden and illegal (Copyright), 
 you will also be reported on steam. We've put a lot of effort into making others enjoy, if you really want to create your own mods, do it honestly. 
 We have different ways to  guess if you are using our mods for your own purposes. Please  do it yourself,  
 because we've seen people steal our mods many times. We check most mods in this regard.
