[h2]Australian Operators Mod (v0.1.0.6)[/h2]

[b][u]What Does This Mod Add?[/u][/b]
- New Police, Fire & Medical Incidents 
- 41 New Incidents (This mod adds many sub-types and variants of a single incident, to keep things interesting)
- 10 New Vehicles
- Highly Detailed and Accurate to the Law After Action Reports (I really want reading those to be fun for the player)
- Complex Incidents (Timers and scripts help make incidents more complex & unique, progress over time and react to certain situations).

[b][u]About this Mod[/u][/b]
This mod is designed by an Australian, a Programmer (Experienced in Modding and Unity Game Design) and an Australian Accredited Rescue Operator. Elements are been added with my own experience as an emergency first responder in mind.
This mod aims to add Australian elements to the game from similar incidents based on AU law, Australian Service Vehicles and 000 emergency calls. Anyone anywhere can add these though to add more content to their game.
I've aimed to try and always keep people guessing, I want every incident that looks the same to have the chance to throw something new at the player. This has been done through incident sub-types (these act and look like a normal incident but when you arrive they can be very different). This mod is designed to realistically reflect Australian crimes and emergencies as well as accurate costs (including fines). It is intended to fill the void in the sense and make things like shootings a lot less common compared to speeding or driving offences. 

Elements added by this mod are normally rare, I have tried to realistically match the real life Australian statistical chance of the player having one of the incidents in this mod. They are also less often seen as I do not want this mod to drown out the stock incidents or other mods, rather compliment them and feel apart of the game.
Please note however, After Action Reports & Calls are designed for Australia and make reference to Australian organisations and laws. This may conflict with how you may enjoy the game.

[b]Roadmap:[/b]

- Add Fully Voice Acted '000' Calls (These calls will be structured to blend into the game and the 112 Operator voice actor and have full English voice acting support)
- Add more Australian Service Vehicles
