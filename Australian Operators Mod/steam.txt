[h2]Australian Operators Mod (v0.1.0.3)[/h2]

[b][u]BETA PERIOD ACTIVE[/u][/b]
This mod is in its very early stages, while testing is done rather thoroughly, there may be issues present. This mod is currently lacking the content I'd consider to make it acceptable as a true release but I really love this game and I want others to be able to enjoy what I've added so far. I do want player feedback, if you want anything added, ask away!
Content is constantly been added and jumping in now you'll be able to see this mod grow.

[b][u]What Does This Mod Add?[/u][/b]
- New Police & Medical Incidents (Fire are planned but not added yet sorry!)
- 9 New Incident Types (6 Police & 3 Medical)
- Total of 36 New Incidents (This mod adds many sub-types and variants of a single incident, to keep things interesting)
- 1 New Vehicle
- Highly Detailed and Accurate to the Law After Action Reports (I really want reading those to be fun for the player)

[b][u]Current Focus as of 14/10/20[/u][/b]
- Add enough content to consider mod for initial release (probably at around that 100 incident mark and several vehicles before I'd consider it a full mod, support will never end however.)

[b][u]About this Mod[/u][/b]
This mod is designed by an Australian, a Programmer (Experienced in Modding and Unity Game Design) and an Australian Accredited Rescue Operator. Elements are been added with my own experience as an emergency first responder in mind.
This mod aims to add Australian elements to the game from similar incidents based on AU law, Australian Service Vehicles and 000 emergency calls. Anyone anywhere can add these though to add more content to their game.
I've aimed to try and always keep people guessing, I want every incident that looks the same to have the chance to throw something new at the player. This has been done through incident sub-types (these act and look like a normal incident but when you arrive they can be very different). This mod is designed to realistically reflect Australian crimes and emergencies as well as accurate costs (including fines). It is intended to fill the void in the sense and make things like shootings a lot less common compared to speeding or driving offences.
